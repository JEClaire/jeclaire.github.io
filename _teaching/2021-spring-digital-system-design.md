This course focuses on system design using computers, covering methods for addressing design requirements such as modeling and simulation. It emphasizes the use of computer-aided design (CAD) tools to solve these problems effectively.  

As a TA, my responsibilities included:

Grading: Evaluating midterm and final exams to assess student understanding.
Lab Assignment Management and Evaluation: Preparing lab assignments, uploading student code to FPGA boards to verify functionality, and grading their hands-on assignments based on performance and correctness.
FPGA Board Management: Maintaining and managing experimental FPGA boards used in the course.
