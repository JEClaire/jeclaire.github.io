This course offers students the opportunity to apply their expertise in architecture and VLSI design to develop hardware for an application of their choice and complete a full chip design cycle within a 15-week timeline. The course culminates in students taping out their own chip using Intel's advanced 16nm technology.

Students work in small teams (4â€“5 members) to design and fabricate their chips. Teams are required to include at least two members committed to participating in post-silicon bringup in an ASIC prototyping lab, ensuring a comprehensive learning experience from initial design to fabrication and validation.

As a TA, my responsibilities included:

Weekly Team Sync-ups: Guiding students through the design process, ensuring project milestones were met, and providing technical assistance.  
Top Module Integration: Compiling and verifying individual design blocks submitted by students, designing the top-level module, and preparing the final design for fabrication.  
Post-Silicon Support: Assisting with chip bringup in the lab once fabricated designs were returned.
