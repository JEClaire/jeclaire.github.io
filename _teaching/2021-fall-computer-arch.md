Term: Fall 2021  
This course builds upon the foundations of Digital Engineering and Introduction to Computer Programming, exploring the execution and operation of instructions within a computer, along with the associated logic and organization. The primary focus is on CPU architecture, covering:

The structure and operation of the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
The organization and functionality of memory.
Logical structures for subroutine execution, including the roles of the stack, stack pointer (SP), and program counter (PC).
The operation of the instruction register (IR) and instruction decoder (ID) using RTL (Register Transfer Level) logic.
Students gain practical experience by learning fundamental assembly programming concepts. The course aims to equip students with the skills to work with computer systems and provides a foundation for understanding CPU and interface design.  

As a TA, my responsibilities included:  

• Grading: Evaluating midterm and final exams to assess student understanding.  
• Lab Assignment Management and Evaluation: grading their assignments based on performance and correctness.
