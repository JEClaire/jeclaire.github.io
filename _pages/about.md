---
Hi, I'm Claire Jeongeun Kim, currently a Ph.D. student at University of Southern California. 🐎✌️
I'm grateful to be advised by Professor [Christopher Torng](https://ctorng.com) and to be a member of [Acorn Research Group](https://acorn-research.usc.edu) 🐿️. My research interests are in the area of computer architecture, VLSI and fundamental abstractions for agile chip development methodologies.  

------
During my master’s studies, I was advised by Professor [Seung Eun Lee](https://soc.seoultech.ac.kr/Professor/Professor.html).  
For more information about the lab, please visit the [Computer Architecture Lab](https://soc.seoultech.ac.kr/) and [my personal page](https://soc.seoultech.ac.kr/Alumni/Kim_JE.html).
