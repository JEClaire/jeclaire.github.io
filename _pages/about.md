title: About me
---
Hi, I'm Claire Jeongeun Kim, currently a Ph.D. student at University of Southern California, advised by Professor [Christopher Torng](https://ctorng.com). My research interests are in the area of computer architecture, VLSI and fundamental abstractions for agile chip development methodologies.  
For more information about our lab and ongoing projects, please visit our [Acorn Research Group](https://acorn-research.usc.edu).
